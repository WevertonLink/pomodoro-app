# Pomodoro App - Cursor Rules

## Project Context
Building a premium Pomodoro Timer PWA with React + Vite + TypeScript, focusing on modern UI/UX, cloud sync, task management, and productivity analytics.

## Tech Stack
- Framework: React 18 + Vite + TypeScript (strict mode)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- State Management: Jotai (atomic state)
- Animations: Framer Motion
- Storage: LocalStorage with migration path to Supabase
- Audio: Custom sound library with Web Audio API
- PWA: vite-plugin-pwa with Workbox
- Router: React Router v6
- Date Utils: date-fns

## Core Principles

### 1. Component Architecture
- Use functional components with TypeScript
- Keep components small and focused (< 150 lines)
- Use barrel exports (index.ts) for clean imports

### 2. TypeScript Standards
- Always define explicit types, avoid 'any'
- Use const assertions for constants
- Prefer type over interface for unions/primitives

### 3. Jotai State Management
- Use atomic state pattern with atomWithStorage for persistence
- Create derived atoms for computed values

### 4. shadcn/ui Usage
- Always use provided shadcn components from /components/ui
- Customize via className, never modify component source

### 5. Accessibility
- Always include ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader announcements

### 6. Performance
- Lazy load routes with React.lazy()
- Memoize expensive calculations
- Use CSS animations over JS when possible

## What NOT to Do
❌ DO NOT use class components
❌ DO NOT use inline styles (use Tailwind)
❌ DO NOT mutate state directly
❌ DO NOT ignore TypeScript errors
❌ DO NOT use 'any' type
❌ DO NOT modify files I didn't ask you to change
❌ DO NOT add features I didn't request

## File Naming
- Components: PascalCase (TimerDisplay.tsx)
- Hooks: camelCase with 'use' prefix (useTimer.ts)
- Utils: camelCase (formatTime.ts)
- Stores: kebab-case (timer-store.ts)

REMEMBER: Only change what was explicitly requested!
